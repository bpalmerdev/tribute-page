          <p>At only 25 years old, Chronixx is poised to become the leader of what's being called the "reggae revival" movement in Jamaica. But this revival is certainly not limited to the shores of the small Caribbean nation, as Chronixx has toured in the US, across Europe, Africa, and Japan. He's also been featured in an Adidas ad campaign and has appeared twice on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."</p>
          <h3>"I grew up in a place called De La Vega..."</h3>
          <p>Born Jamar McNaughton in De La Vega City in Spanish Town, Jamaica, Chronixx was destined for a music career. His father and dancehall artist, Chronicle, exposed him to music from an early age. Chronixx wrote his first song at 5 years old, recorded his first track at 11, and began producing at 14. Inspired by a variety of musical influences, from Ska to blues to hip hop, Chronixx's music attracts a diverse range of listeners, trascending age and racial barriers--reminiscent of past Reggae greats such as Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, and Gregory Issacs.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, Chronixx's goal is to integrate modern musical influences with original reggae roots. To learn more about Chronixx and his music, check out <a href= "http://www.chronixxmusic.com/">www.chronixxmusic.com</a>.</p>
